# dwolla-ruby: Ruby Wrapper for Dwolla's API
=================================================================================

## Version
1.0.0

## Requirements
- [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/)

## Installation
The easiest way to install the dwolla gem for now is to use bundler and add the following line to your Gemfile:

gem 'dwolla', :git => 'git://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-ruby.git'

If you install via Rubygems you will install the original Dwolla gem which no longer works with the current API.  The rubygems.org gem should be updated shortly to fix this problem.

## Usage
```ruby

```

## Examples / Quickstart

This repo includes various usage examples, including:

* Authenticating with OAuth [oauth.rb]
* Sending money [send.rb]
* Fetching account information [accountInfo.rb]
* Grabbing a user's contacts [contacts.rb]
* Listing a user's funding sources [fundingSources.rb]
* Creating offsite gateway sessions [offsiteGateway.rb]
