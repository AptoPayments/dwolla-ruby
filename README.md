# dwolla-ruby

Official Ruby wrapper for Dwolla's v1 API

## Deprecation warning
This repository is for an old version of our API and is no longer actively maintained. Please use our [new SDKs](https://developers.dwolla.com/pages/sdks.html).

[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

## Version
2.8.0

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Dwolla/dwolla-ruby.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Dwolla/dwolla-ruby)

## Requirements
- [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/)

## Installation
The easiest way to install the dwolla-ruby gem for now is to use bundler and add the following line to your Gemfile:

   `gem 'dwolla-ruby'`

The recommended way to install dwolla-ruby is through RubyGems:

   `gem install dwolla-ruby`

## Examples / Quickstart

To use the examples in the /examples folder, first edit the _keys.rb file and add your Dwolla API application's key, and secret, along with your account's [OAuth token](https://developers.dwolla.com/dev/token), and PIN.

This repo includes various usage examples, including:

* Authenticating with OAuth [oauth.rb]
* Fetching user information [users.rb]
* Grabbing a user's contacts [contacts.rb]
* Listing a user's funding sources [fundingSources.rb]
* Transacting money (includes sending) [transactions.rb]
* Getting a user's balance [balance.rb]

## Concurrent requests

If making requests using any background processing library such as `Sidkiq` or `Resque`, we recommend that you manually pass in tokens to functions which take an OAuth token. 

For example, we can do this with the `Contacts` class:

```ruby
# Include the Dwolla gem
require 'rubygems'
require 'pp'
require 'dwolla'

Dwolla::Contacts.get(nil, "your_token")
```

## Changelog

2.8.0
* Add deprecation warning.

2.7.0
* Fix loss of filter parameters issue in `Transactions#get`. (thanks, @jackchang!)

2.6.9
* Handling of network errors has improved. If there is any issue receiving an API response an `APIConnectionError` will now be thrown. 

2.6.8
* Updated `rest_client` version constraint for better compatibility.

2.6.7
* Removed `pin` as required argument for certain transactional operations due to compliance with Dwolla Direct.
* Updated `rest_client` version constraint due to security concerns.
* Refactored OAuth URL generation function.

2.6.6
* Added new `verified_account` parameter to authorization URL.

2.6.5
* Added new catalog endpoint to OAuth module + unit tests and examples.
* Added new scheduled transaction endpoints to Transactions module + unit tests and examples.

2.6.4
* Fixed bug with refresh token call.  Parameters were not being JSON encoded.  Now OAuth `get_token` and `refresh_auth` calls use POST instead of GET.  

2.6.3
* Fixed webhook validation, cleaned up OpenSSL Digest calls (thanks, @michaelblinn)!

2.6.2
* Fixed bug with generation of Off-Site Gateway checkout URLs

2.6.1
* Minor refactoring, fixed bug that would cause crashes in certain Ruby version with checking if keys exist in hashes.

2.6.0

* **BREAKING CHANGE**: OAuth access tokens now expire. Instead of a string, `Dwolla::OAuth::get_token` now returns a hash with an `access_token`, `refresh_token`, and expiration times in seconds for both. In order to refresh authorization, use `Dwolla::OAuth.refresh_auth`

* Proper unit tests implemented for all endpoints.
